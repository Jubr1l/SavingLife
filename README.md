## Description
A charity campaign is a fundraising effort that aims to raise money, awareness, and support for a charitable cause or organization. It typically involves a coordinated effort to promote the cause, solicit donations, and engage with the public to encourage participation. Charity campaigns can take many different forms, including online fundraising drives, benefit concerts, charity auctions, telethons, and social media campaigns.
